Q2. Explain the difference between absolute and relative positions.

Ans.Absolute Positioning -> in absolute positioning the element whose position is 
declared as absolute is placed relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, 
if there does not exist any positioned ancestor then it positions itself according to 
the <html> or <body> element. the position of other elements around it also get repositioned.
Relative Positioning -> in relative positioning the element whose position is declared as 
relative is placed relative to its normal position in the document flow. other elements around
it does not change its position.
